### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Steven Perez, I am currently working on an Elden Ring based project with async/await and fetch api, I am making it so fans like myself can use it to refer to certain items and also because I get to practice more of my React and API skills. Check it out Below! <a href='https://elden-ring-directory-stevenalp18.netlify.app/'>Elden Ring Directory</a>.

Check out the other projects I have below, such as the 

Quote Generator (API, React, Tailwind, Vite)
Travel Journey (React, Tailwind, Vite)
Personal Portfolio (React, Tailwind, Vite)

Reach out if you have any questions via my portfolio, I would be more than happy to chat! :)
