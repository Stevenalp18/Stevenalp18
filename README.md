### Hi there 👋

I am Steven Perez, 

I am currently working on two projects, an Elden Ring based project with async/await and the elden ring API, I am making it so fans like myself can use it to refer to certain items while learning more about certain web technologies. Check out my <a href='https://github.com/Stevenalp18/elden-ring-directory'>repo</a> until I get it live!

The second project is a small weather application, where I use three different API's (Current, Forecast, Search) to connect my app together, I attempt to use redux as well for simple global data, the repository is attached <a href="https://github.com/Stevenalp18/weather-app">here</a>


Check out the other projects I have below, such as the
